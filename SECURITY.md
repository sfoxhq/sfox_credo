# SfoxCredo Security

## LLM-Generated Security Report Policy

Absolutely no security reports will be accepted that have been generated solely
by LLM agents. There must be a human that confirms the issue.

## Supported Versions

Security reports are accepted for the most recent major release with support for
the previous major version ending immediately.

SfoxCredo supports at most the three most recent versions of Elixir
and supported [Erlang/OTP versions][otp-versions].

As of September 2026, the support list is:

| Elixir | Erlang         |
| ------ | -------------- |
| 1.17   | 25, 26, 27, 28 |
| 1.18   | 25, 26, 27, 28 |
| 1.19   | 26, 27, 28     |
| 1.20   | 27, 28, 29     |

The oldest supported version of Elixir will not be deprecated until six months
after the release of a new version of Elixir.
